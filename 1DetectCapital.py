#Given a word, you need to judge whether the usage of capitals in it is right or not.
#We define the usage of capitals in a word to be right when one of the following cases holds:
#1All letters in this word are capitals, like "USA".
#2All letters in this word are not capitals, like "leetcode".
#3Only the first letter in this word is capital, like "Google".
#4Otherwise, we define that this word doesn't use capitals in a right way.

            return True
        elif word == word.capitalize():
            return True
